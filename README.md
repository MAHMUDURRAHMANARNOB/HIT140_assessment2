# 🦇🐀 Bat–Rat Foraging Behaviour Study

This project investigates the **foraging behaviour of Egyptian Fruit Bats (_Rousettus aegyptiacus_)** in the presence of **Black Rats (_Rattus rattus_)**.  
The study is based on 7 months of surveillance video recordings from a semi-natural bat colony. Two datasets were provided:

- **dataset1.csv** → Each row = a single bat landing event.
- **dataset2.csv** → Each row = a 30-minute observation interval with rat activity and bat landings.

The goal of this project is to **clean, analyze, and visualize** the behavioural interactions of bats and rats, focusing on:
- Whether bats perceive rats as **competitors or predators**.
- How behaviours change across **seasons**.
